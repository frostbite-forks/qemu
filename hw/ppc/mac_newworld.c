 * the primary CPU's own concurrent, un-arbitrated cold-init ROM code --
 * two independent races were found running that shared path on both CPUs
 * at once (Keywest I2C, and a callback/vector-table setup routine).
 *
 * Two things were tried and rejected before this:
 *
 * 1) Jump straight to the trampoline the ROM has already copied to
 *    physical 0x500 (see the cpu-probe? decompile:
 *    "cpu-vector 500 h#10 move"), leaving SRR0 untouched. This avoids
 *    both known races (verified live: the CPU parks in a clean, stable,
 *    non-oscillating wait loop, not either race's address) and runs
 *    genuinely correct ROM code -- but cpu-probe? still always saw a
 *    false ack, because the trampoline's first action is
 *    `mfspr r0, SRR0; stw r0, 0x10(cpu-info)`: SRR0 itself *is* the ack
 *    value, and a raw NIP poke leaves it at its power-on value of zero.
 *
 * 2) Model this as a real HID0[NHR] soft-reset exception (see the
 *    MPC7410 manual's system-reset chapter) into the ROM's own reset
 *    vector, so SRR0 lands on the CPU's pre-reset NIP the way real
 *    hardware's SRESET would. This reaches the real soft-reset dispatch
 *    correctly (confirmed: HID0 reads back with NHR set, and the CPU
 *    heads toward the trampoline via the ROM's own code) but the shared
 *    prologue every reset runs through first (`bl 0xfff0060c`, common to
 *    both hard- and soft-reset) checks UniNorth HWINIT_STATE and hangs
 *    (`b .` at 0xfff03600) whenever it's already progressed past its own
 *    early boot phase -- true by the time anything triggers this pulse
 *    (confirmed live: HWINIT_STATE reads 0x2, its steady-state value,
 *    well under a second after boot starts).
 *
 * This combines what worked from each: jump straight to the trampoline
 * (skips the HWINIT_STATE-sensitive shared prologue entirely, same as
 * attempt 1) but with SRR0 forced nonzero first (fixes attempt 1's
 * always-false ack, without needing the real reset-vector plumbing
 * attempt 2 went through to get there). Force the CPU back to halted
 * shortly after either way -- nothing here can safely let it keep
 * running the ROM's shared init state indefinitely.

 * create en0 without it; a "built-in" property additionally makes it show as
 * "Built-in Ethernet" rather than a PCI slot. The real Apple ROM's own gmac
 * driver never publishes these -- its (open) aborts on an internal ALLOC-MEM
 * cap before it gets there -- so we inject them ourselves via the OF
 * "boot-command" variable, honouring whatever MAC the gmac was given on the
 * command line (or QEMU's default when none was specified).
 *
 * A real PowerMac3,4 publishes /cpus/PowerPC,G4@0/l2cr = 0xb9000000 and a
 * child "l2-cache" node (1MB unified, 64-byte lines, 0x2000 sets, 233MHz --
 * verbatim from a real lsprop dump). Our 7450-family L2CR write path was
 * already fixed (commit 33231ae62a), but the ROM's own L2 bring-up/POST
 * still never runs on QEMU's transparent memory model, so the device tree
 * ends up with neither property and /diagnostics/post-results (the POST
 * failure bitmask a real healthy Mac reads back as 0x00000000) is left
 * non-zero -- which is what Mac OS surfaces as "a problem with cache
 * memory". Graft both: the l2cr/l2-cache data a real machine has, and a
 * zeroed post-results, so Mac OS sees exactly what a passing POST would
 * have produced.
 *
 * boot-command (not nvramrc) is used deliberately: nvramrc runs before
 * probe-all, when /pci@f4000000/ethernet@f does not yet exist; boot-command
 * runs at the end of start-up, after the PCI ethernet node has been probed
 * and after /diagnostics/post-results has already been written by the ROM's
 * own (failing) POST, so it is the right point to overwrite both.
 *
 * The nvram is Apple/CHRP format: an 8KB image mirrored inside the 16KB
 * flash, OF variables stored as name=value NUL strings in the "common"
 * partition. Every edit must fix both the per-partition header checksum and
 * the outer Adler32 (at copy+0x10, over [copy+0x14 : copy+0x2000]); without
 * the latter the ROM rejects the image ("NVRAM corrupted") and wipes it.
 */
/*
 * A blank/never-written flash NVRAM (all bytes 0xff, matching real erased-
 * flash semantics) has no valid CHRP partition structure at all for
 * core99_nvram_graft()/core99_nvram_set_bootcmd() to patch into -- their
 * search loop for the "common" (0x70) partition finds nothing and silently
 * no-ops. The real Apple ROM detects this as "NVRAM corrupted" and rebuilds
 * its own default structure, but only in its own in-guest working copy;
 * that repair is never observed to persist back to the emulated flash's
 * backing file (confirmed live: even a full, successful boot leaves a
 * freshly-created backing file completely unchanged). Net effect: every
 * boot-command graft (gmac MAC, FireWire GUID, cache-POST) silently never
 * applies on a genuinely fresh nvram-flash-*.img, only on one a real ROM
 * has already formatted at some point in the past.
 *
 * Seed a real, byte-for-byte, ROM-validated default structure instead of
 * hand-constructing one -- extracted directly from a real PowerMac3,4
 * nvram-flash-34.img's second 8KB copy (the first copy in that same real
 * file is itself blank/unused, matching typical flash wear-leveling; only
 * one live copy is needed for the ROM's own scan to find). This is the
 * exact same "copy a real captured byte blob rather than reconstruct the
 * format from a spec" approach already used for the Old World OF partition
 * template above (see oldworld_of_partition_head/_strings) -- safer than
 * hand-rolling the "system" (0x5f, Apple-specific, not the generic CHRP
 * tag) and "APL,MacOS75" partitions this real capture also contains, which
 * this code has no need to understand the contents of, only to reproduce
 * faithfully enough that the real ROM's own validation accepts the whole
 * copy as uncorrupted.
