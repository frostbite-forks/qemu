/*
 * QEMU ATI Rage 128 Pro emulation
 *
 * Models the ATI Rage 128 Pro (PCI vendor 0x1002, device 0x5046 "PF")
 * as an add-in graphics card for the Beige Power Mac G3 (g3beige)
 * machine. This is a NEW device, deliberately separate from both
 * upstream's ati-vga (ati.c, which also targets Rage 128 Pro but is
 * built around the VGA core for Linux/PC-style guests) and our own
 * ati-mach64-gt (the machine's onboard chip) -- following the same
 * "own device, own register file, matched against Mac ground truth"
 * approach that made the mach64 bring-up succeed.
 *
 * The card identity (0x5046) is chosen to match the PCIR header of the
 * real ATI OEM Rage 128 Pro ROM (an AGP card's ROM -- the Beige G3 is
 * PCI-only, but QEMU has no AGP bus and models AGP devices as PCI
 * devices; the ROM's FCode must find a device whose vendor/device IDs
 * match its PCIR or Open Firmware will not bind/run it). The FCode in
 * that ROM (detokenized 2026-08-01) is the ground truth for the BAR
 * layout below: it looks up config offset 0x10 (memory, framebuffer
 * aperture), 0x18 (memory, 16KB register aperture) and 0x14 (I/O
 * register access, 256 bytes) in assigned-addresses and maps them with
 * "map-in", then flips the PCI command register bits itself via
 * config-b@/config-b!.

     * with a pitch left over from an earlier, differently sized surface.
